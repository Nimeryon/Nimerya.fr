# Your amazing app

## Description
Here is a template for using an express backend with a react frontend.

## Setup

* Use the `.env` file to hide any information (like API keys) from the repository
* Add any file or folder to `.gitignore` to have it not uploaded to the repository

## Use

* Use `npm install` to install all dependencies.
* To use it first build the react app with `npm run build` then start the server with `npm run start`.

## Available npm scripts

```
npm run start           # Start the node js server
npm run dev             # Start the node js server with nodemon
npm run build           # Start webpack (build the bundle js file)
```
